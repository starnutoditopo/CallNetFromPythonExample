# Call .Net from Python

Simple experiments with PythonNet

This project aims to reproduce the problem described at https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet/issues/2018 (the solution is described by Benedikt Reinartz at https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet/issues/2018#issuecomment-1324793412 )

# Quick run with VsCode and Docker container

- clone this repository

- within Visual Studio Code, open the project's folder in container; When the container is built, the .Net projects are built.

- within Visual Studio Code, open a terminal and, from the default path ( /workspaces/CallNetFromPythonExample ), run `python factorial.py`
